This repository contains the code and dataset for our Computer Vision course AOL Project. The project focuses on detecting and recognizing celebrity faces using computer vision techniques. The dataset includes a diverse collection of celebrity images, and the code implements face detection, feature extraction, and classification algorithms to achieve reliable recognition. This project demonstrates the practical application of computer vision in facial recognition tasks.
